# Driver-Churn-Prediction-Ensemle-ML-models

**Objective**

Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for Ola. Churn among drivers is high and it’s very easy for drivers to stop working for the service on the fly or jump to Uber depending on the rates.
As the companies get bigger, the high churn could become a bigger problem. To find new drivers, Ola is casting a wide net, including people who don’t have cars for jobs. But this acquisition is really costly. Losing drivers frequently impacts the morale of the organization and acquiring new drivers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.
You are working as a data scientist with the Analytics Department of Ola, focused on driver team attrition. You are provided with the monthly information for a segment of drivers for 2019 and 2020 and tasked to predict whether a driver will be leaving the company or not based on their attributes like

**Outcome of Project**

1) Drivers who left the job have no total bussiness value or theire rides have very high precentage of cancellation and refunds as compared to drivers who are still in ola so its recommended to Ola make sure driver have less no of cnacellation of rides or refunds the possibale reason for cancellation and refund can be found out if we have additional data .
2) Males are generally quiting theire jobs from Ola than women, this is may be happening due to finding better earning opportunity from other cab service providers like Uber. It can be prevent by giving incetives for number of miles driven during a day this will encourage the drivers to work for Ola.
3) Here we can see most of the drivers who had not able to increase their income are the ones who are leaving Ola .
4) Drivers who have no improvement in quaterly rating are more likely to leave Ola , quaterly rating plays important role in earning of the driver. Hence Ola could conduct some training sessions and train them regarding importance of ratings and it's effect on earning potential.
5) More number of men have incremented their income than womens this may be due to more number of mens have able to improve their quaterly ratings.
